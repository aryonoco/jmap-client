 * jmap_client — C API for the jmap-client JMAP (RFC 8620/8621) library.
 *
 * Contract summary (details on each declaration):
 *   - Call jmap_init() once per process before anything else; only
 *     jmap_strerror() and jmap_version() are callable before it.
 *   - Every fallible function returns a jmap_status; outputs travel
 *     through out-parameters. Rich diagnostics: jmap_errmsg(client).
 *   - The library owns everything its read accessors return: a
 *     const char* or view is a borrow, valid until the handle that
 *     produced it is freed (jmap_errmsg's borrow is also invalidated
 *     by the next fallible call on the same client). Never free a
 *     borrow. Objects are released only via their paired jmap_*_free.
 *   - A handle is confined to one thread at a time; hand a handle to
 *     another thread by ceasing to use it on the old one.
 *   - This header is the ABI: symbols are appended, ordinals never
 *     reused, nothing removed after v1 (additive-only until a SemVer
 *     policy document supersedes this note).
